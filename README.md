# The project summary

The aim of this project is to analyse the housing market in King County for my stakeholder Mrs. Nicole Johnson. Different requirements of Mrs. Johnson have to be taken into account during the analysis. The project documentation consists of a PDF file containing a presentation of the results and a Jupyter notebook as data analysis environment.

## Requirements

- pyenv
- python==3.9.8

## Setup

One of the first steps when starting any data science project is to create a virtual environment. For this project you have to create this environment from scratch yourself. However, you should be already familiar with the commands you will need to do so. The general workflow consists of... 

* setting the python version locally to 3.9.8
* creating a virtual environment using the `venv` module
* activating your newly created environment 
* upgrading `pip` (This step is not absolutely necessary, but will save you trouble when installing some packages.)
* installing the required packages via `pip`


## PDF file: King County market analysis for Mrs. Johnson 

The PDF file contains a market analysis of the housing market for King County based on the King County housing database. First a general overview of the housing market in King County is being given Then Mrs. Johnson's requirements of housing (lively, central neighbourhood, mid-price range and right timing (within a year)) are the foundation of the anlysis shown in this PDF. It ends up in special housing recommendations for Mrs. Johnson.
